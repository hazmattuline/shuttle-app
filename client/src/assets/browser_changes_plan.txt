1:30:53 PM: otw
2:05:05 PM: let me know when to comeover
3:44:22 PM: i found that if we  shift photo to middle of screen our coordinates mess upEmily Steinebrey: 
3:44:46 PM: Yeah, it's pretty sensitive
3:45:05 PM: Is it an offset problem or more than that?Diontre Pate: 
3:45:20 PM: coordinates sit in same spot 
3:45:24 PM: just not on imageEmily Steinebrey: 
3:46:25 PM: Yeah, that's how they're coded right now
3:46:42 PM: The offsets are not off of the location of the image
3:46:56 PM: They are of the window itselfDiontre Pate: 
3:47:18 PM: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhEmily Steinebrey: 
3:48:38 PM: Yeah, every point would need its x or y location changed by the offset if the image changes location
3:49:01 PM: I don't think that the offset is from the top of the window though; maybe right under the green text
3:49:36 PM: It would be better if we could find a way to make it all relative to the top corner of the image exactlyDiontre Pate: 
3:49:52 PM: absolutely!
3:50:22 PM: thats really interestingEmily Steinebrey: 
3:50:48 PM: Not a hard change to just manipulate the offsets but since we need to accommodate different browser sizes and the offsets would not change in a very predictable way, we will probably need to have the offsets go from the image location
3:51:16 PM: Additionally, we should make the offsets in terms of the image size so they can generalize to different browser and image sizes

Diontre Pate: 
3:51:55 PM: totally i think if we put all those dots wrapped in the image div i think thatll work that way no matter how the screen is positioned the dots wont change
